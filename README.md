This is a leanring project where we try to implement DentistSmile - Jekyll Theme. this is a single page Jekyll theme for dental clinics. It's easily customizable and responsive. It comes with svg icons, google map and a working contact form. Docs can be found [here](http://obaez.com/dentistsmile-docs/).

Here is a [live Demo](http://obaez.com/dentistsmile/)

While customizing, we shall try to leverage the existing theme however for to be by preschools.
